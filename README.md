### Research objectives

This code showcases the analysis of the glacier retreat in the Nationalpark Hohe Tauern in Austria between 2013 and 2022 with Landsat-8 data within in the programming environment R. In addition to that, the project aims to reveal the extent of topographic control on ice loss in the study region by applying a logistic regression model with terrain indices as predictors of ice loss. The ice loss was further correlated with the size of individual glaciers in a last step.

### Research findings

The project showed that elevation and glacier size are major controlling variables of glacier retreat in this alpine study region. Ice loss was observed at all kinds of glacier surface gradients and orientations. Especially large valley glaciers showed high area losses of ice surface. The Pasterze glacier in the center of the Nationalpark Hohe Tauern revealed by far the highest ice loss of more than 3 sqkm between 2013 and 2022. In total, about 47 sqkm of glacier area vanished in the national park within the last ten years, representing almost one third of the overall glaciated area. In a future with unbraked climate change, glaciers might only prevail at higher elevations in sun-averted sites. However, this study region extents not even to 4000 m a.s.l. and even the size of an individual glacier can not mitigate this trend.
